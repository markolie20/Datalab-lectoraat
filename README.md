# 🧠 Chat Summary Model

A project focused on building an AI-powered summarization model for chat dialogues. Our goal is to generate concise and accurate summaries from multi-turn chat conversations—ideal for customer service, team chats, or any other dialogue-heavy environments.

## 🔍 Description

This project is developing a summarization model tailored for dialog boxes or chat transcripts. Because clean, real-world datasets are limited, we are leveraging **Gemini** to generate synthetic yet realistic chat data. The generated data is then used to train and evaluate summarization approaches.

---

## 🧪 Folders Overview

### `EDA/`
Contains notebooks and scripts for data exploration—checking distributions, message lengths, role patterns, and initial summary quality.

### `Data_generation/`
This folder handles the creation of synthetic conversations:

- **`agent.py`** — Logic for simulating different agent personas in a conversation.  
- **`bio_generation.py`** — Generates user biographies or background info to help create more context-rich chats.  
- **`custom_expectations.py`** — Defines domain-specific rules or expectations to guide chat generation.  
- **`group_generation.py`** — Combines agents and bios to create diverse group interactions.

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Synthetic data generation pipeline
- [x] Initial EDA on synthetic conversations
- [ ] Chat summarization model (in progress)
- [ ] Evaluation metrics and fine-tuning

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-summary-model.git
cd chat-summary-model
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (coming soon when requirements are finalized):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run data generation:

```bash
python Data_generation/group_generation.py
```

---

## 🤖 Model Goals

Eventually, the model should:

- Take in multi-turn chat logs
- Understand speaker context and flow
- Output accurate, coherent summaries in natural language
